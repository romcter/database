NoSql db is better using for sharding because they have default mechanize for that. MongoDB is document-orientate db, but under the hood it save in BSON format (something similar to json but binary).
In `MongoDB` we have default method for work with AWS lambda (for example, some type in object will change and Lambda going to start)
